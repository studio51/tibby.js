# tibby.js
Multi Tabbed Navigation + History

## Reason

I created Tibby.js because I needed to be able to have multiple Tabbed navigations on a page. Though this is possible with many other plugins out there, what they're lacking is the ability to set the History, with multiple tabs, and allow a User to go back using the browser back functionality.

Tibby.js also allows you to write your URLs like `#main-navigation=overview,leaderboards-navigation=all` which in return will 'activate' all your page tabs, and their corespnding tab.

Working example: https://games.directory/games/xbox_live/tom-clancy-s-rainbow-six-siege#main-navigation=leaderboards,leaderboards-navigation=all

## Tabby.JS has been inspired by the following plugins:

https://github.com/cferdinandi/tabby

#### Please note that this is merely a draft and it's been developed in, and for, https://games.directory/
I will set aside some time to write this into a proper plugin.
